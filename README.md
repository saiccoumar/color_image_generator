# Color Block Image Generator
A python script to generate 500x500 images based on color codes because oh my god why is that such a pain to find on google without ads
## Instructions
```
python color.py r g b filename
```
Just download the file, pip install PIL if you don't have it and replace r, g, and b with your desired rgb codes. I used a color picker on google to find rgb values of the colors I wanted. The filename should follow basic file pathing restrictions and I didn't do any safety stripping of the text. If you mess that one up good luck.

This took me like 2 minutes max I can't believe there seriously isn't a better alternative online.
